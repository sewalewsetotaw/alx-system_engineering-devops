### Additional Elements and Why They Are Added

## Extra Load Balancer (HAProxy 2)

    High Availability. If HAProxy 1 fails, HAProxy 2 can take over, ensuring zero downtime.

## Separation of Web and Application Servers

    Improves scalability, security, and maintenance. Each role can be scaled independently.

## Dedicated Database Servers

    Splitting into one Primary (writes) and multiple Replicas (reads) reduces load on the primary database.
