### What is a server?

A server is a computer (hardware) or a program (software) that provides services to other computers, called clients, over a network. In this case, our server hosts the website and responds to user/client requests.

## What is the role of the domain name?

A domain name is a human-readable address that maps to the server’s IP address.

## What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?

www is a subdomain of foobar.com. It will be an A record that directly maps www.foobar.com to the server’s IP address (8.8.8.8).

## What is the role of the web server (Nginx)?

The web server handles HTTP requests from users or clients.

## What is the role of the application server?

The application server processes the business logic of the website.

## What is the role of the database (MySQL)?

The database stores, organizes, and retrieves data used by the application.

## What is the server using to communicate with the user’s computer?

The server communicates over the Internet using network protocols like:

    HTTP/HTTPS for web content delivery.

    TCP/IP as the underlying transport protocol.

### ## Issues in This Infrastructure

## Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

If the only server fails (hardware failure, crash, etc.), the entire website becomes unavailable.

## Downtime During Maintenance

Since there’s only one server, updating the code, restarting the web server, or changing configurations will take the site offline temporarily.

## No Scalability

One server cannot handle high traffic loads efficiently. If the number of users spikes, response times will slow down or the site may become unresponsive.
